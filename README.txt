1. Before running codes from the first time, put data file “processed_data” in the same directory as README. Do not change the name as it is used in some codes. 

2. For each session, always run “InitEEGLab.init()” first. It will load all the libraries and capture relevant variables for subsequent use.

3. SVMLight requires installation of “awk” to write files for svmlight software.

4. It is built on Mac and hence may not be compatible with other platforms.
